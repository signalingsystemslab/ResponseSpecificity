# ResponseSpecificity
Quantifying macrophage Response Specificity 

This code generates computational models to quantify macrophage Response Specificity. 
The scriot figures_run.R contains compiled code from all figures in the paper. In particular,
- code for training machine learning models that can be used to assess ligand specificity (Figure 2).
- code for information theoretic frameworks that are employed to quantify the Response Specificity of genes and genesets (Figure 3).
- code for identifying genes that contribute to a summary metric for Response Specificity, called the Response Specificity Score (Figure 6). 

Machine learning and information theory calculations were run on Dual CPU Intel Xeon E5-2690 v3 @ 2.60GHz.
